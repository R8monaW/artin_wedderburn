# ArtinWedderburn

A package for numerically computing irreducible representations of semi-simple algebras over the complex numbers.

### description

Take a semi-simple algebra with basis `e1, ..., ed`. The multiplication tensor is defined by
```
ei ej = sum over k m[i,j,k] ek
```
The algebra unit vector is defined by
```
ei u = u ei = ei for each i
```
ArtinWedderburn takes a multiplication tensor and unit vector and computes the irreducible representations for the algebra (these are only defined upto conjugation). It keeps track of numerical error as it works, so you can see if it is polluting the result.

### usage

```
from ArtinWedderburn import *
alg = symmetric_group_algebra(5)
aw = ArtinWedderburn(alg, logging=True)
```

Currently, on a Ryzen 5 2400G, this runs with the following performance characteristics:
```
User time (seconds): 402.71
System time (seconds): 2.66
Percent of CPU this job got: 716%
Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 0:56.55
Maximum resident set size (kbytes): 9816812
```
The 10GB max ram usage occours while constructing the multiplication tensor for S5. While computing the irreducible representations, the ram usage is approximately 3GB.

Algebra objects can be constructed using `Algebra(dimension, multiplication, unit)` where `multiplication` is a numpy array with shape `(dimension,dimension,dimension)` and `unit` is a numpy vector with length `dimension`.

### dependencies

ArtinWedderburn uses `numpy` for tensor arithmetic and `scipy` for SVDs and computing eigenvalues. It should work with any recent versions of those libraries.
